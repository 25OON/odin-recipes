    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A turkey leg is a large, meaty portion of a turkey's thigh, typically roasted or smoked. It's become a popular food item at fairs, theme parks, and Renaissance festivals. The leg is often seasoned with a savory blend of spices and cooked until the skin is crispy and the meat is tender. Turkey legs are known for their substantial size and are usually eaten by hand, making them a satisfying and somewhat theatrical food choice.</p>
