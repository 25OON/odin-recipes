    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Beignets are a type of French pastry that's particularly associated with New Orleans cuisine. They are square pieces of dough that are deep-fried and generously dusted with powdered sugar. The result is a light, pillowy pastry that's crisp on the outside and soft on the inside. Beignets are often served as a dessert or breakfast item, typically accompanied by coffee. In New Orleans, they're famously served at Caf√© du Monde and are considered a must-try local delicacy.</p>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

        <li>Fry beignets in batches until browned and puffed. (If beignets sink and do not pop up, oil is not hot enough.) Remove from oil with a slotted spoon and drain on paper towels. </li>
