    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A corndog is a popular American snack and fair food consisting of a hot dog sausage that's been coated in a thick layer of cornmeal batter and deep-fried. The hot dog is typically skewered on a wooden stick, making it easy to hold and eat. Corndogs are often served with condiments like ketchup or mustard for dipping. They're commonly found at carnivals, state fairs, and casual dining establishments.</p>
